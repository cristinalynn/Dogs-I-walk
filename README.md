# Description of my 'Dogs I walk' applications

Hello and welcome to my application. Ever since I was a little girl, I loved dogs and always wanted to own lots of them. Unfortuantely, this never happened so I am happy to just take care of, walk and play with someone esle's dogs. I built this application to keep track of all the dogs I walk.
